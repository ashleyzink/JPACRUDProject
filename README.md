# JPACRUDProject

This website allows the user to few the list of boardgames already in the database. Not only that, but it allows them to add their own boardgames, update, and delete them.

## Topics
* MySQL Database
* MySQL Workbench
* JUnit Testing
* Spring Boot
* JPA (Java Persistence API)
* Hibernate
* JSP (Java Server Pages)
* Gradle

## Learning Objectives
Below are a list of objectives that we see the JPACrud application reinforcing.

* Creating a SQL database and subsequent tables.
* Configuring a JPA project.
* Mapping Entities to SQL tables.
* Creating JUnit tests to ensure our JPA mappings are correct.
* Integrating a Spring MVC project with a JPA project.
* Performing basic CRUD operations.
* Deploying an application to AWS

##Lessons Learned

The biggest lessons in this project were to pay CLOSE attention to capitalizations while mapping from the controller to the jsp, as well as making sure to follow the path of those mappings. There was also a learning curve with the MySQL Workbench.

## How to Run
This is more of a how-to on navigation since you're not able to see anything on the back end from the website itself. You're greeted on the front page with the ability to either do a search if you know the game's id #, or you can choose to see the already established list, or add a game if you know what you're there for. If you go to the whole game list, you can then select the game, and it'll give you all of the available information about that board game. If you see something that is incorrect or has changed, there's an update button, or you can just delete if it's no longer of any use. Each different page that you're taken to, there is a return to home page link at the bottom so you're able to start over if you'd like.
